1. What Is Cupid?

Cupid is an Instagram-based online matchmaking and dating platform designed exclusively for college students. Our goal is to help students find meaningful relationships, friendships, and genuine connections within and around their campus network.

We understand that traditional dating apps often feel unreliable, random, and sometimes unsafe for college students. Cupid bridges that gap by creating a secure, data-driven, and college-focused matchmaking system that gives students a chance to meet people who actually share their vibe, background, and relationship goals and other dating apps takes too much time to match you with someone even weeks and months, there's no match making based on personality hence finding someone with whom you can vibe with is kind of difficult and there's no proper customer support even after paying high fees in thousands.

Every 10 days, we roll out a Cupid form on our official Instagram story, which stays live for 24 hours. During this period, students ‚Äî both boys and girls ‚Äî can submit their entries. The form collects basic details, preferences, and relationship expectations to help our team and algorithm identify potential matches.

2. What Information Do We Collect?

While filling the form, students are required to share the following details:

Full Name

Age

Gender

Instagram ID

Email ID

Hometown

Height

Personality Type (Introvert, Extrovert, or Ambivert)

Number of Past Relationships or Exes

Qualities They Look For in a Partner

Preferences for Relationship Type (Casual, Serious, Friendship, etc.)

Non-Negotiables (factors you can‚Äôt compromise on)

These details are essential to make your Cupid profile as accurate and compatible as possible. Your Instagram and email ID are mandatory fields. Without them, registration cannot be completed, and matches cannot be sent.

Phone number is optional ‚Äî if you don‚Äôt want to share your real number, you can simply enter a placeholder such as 9999999999 to avoid submission errors.

Photo upload is optional as well. You can upload any random image if you‚Äôre not comfortable sharing your real photo. At the end of the form, you will be asked for consent ‚Äî whether you are comfortable sharing your photo or not. Your image is shared only if you explicitly agree.

3. What Are ‚ÄúNon-Negotiables‚Äù?

Non-negotiables are the points on which you are not willing to compromise while choosing a match.

For example:
If your non-negotiable is ‚Äúmust be from the same college‚Äù or ‚Äúmust not drink‚Äù, then Cupid will strictly follow those conditions.

If a potential match does not meet any of your non-negotiables, you will not be paired with them ‚Äî even if other traits match perfectly.

This ensures your match truly fits your comfort level and personal boundaries.

4. How Cupid Works (Step-by-Step Process)

Form Announcement:
A Cupid form is posted every 10 days on our official Instagram story. It remains open for 24 hours.

Form Submission:
Students fill the form with accurate details, preferences, and non-negotiables.

Data Analysis:
After form closure, our system and team process the entries. Compatibility is checked between all participants using the data you provide.

Mutual Matching:
A match is confirmed only when both participants‚Äô preferences align with each other‚Äôs profile. Cupid does not generate one-sided or forced matches.

Result Announcement:
Within 1‚Äì2 days after the form closes, matched users receive an email with their partner‚Äôs Instagram ID and details to start a conversation.

Post-Match Interaction:
Once matched, you can connect with your partner directly. Cupid‚Äôs role ends after the introduction. What happens next is up to you.

5. Safety and Privacy

Cupid is absolutely safe and privacy-focused.

We do not collect, sell, or store your personal data for any commercial purpose. Once each round ends, all participant information is permanently deleted from our systems.

Only matched pairs receive each other‚Äôs Instagram IDs ‚Äî no other data is shared publicly.

Cupid has successfully operated in multiple colleges and has already helped over 540 students find matches. Our consistent track record and large number of successful pairings make us a trusted and established name among college students.

6. Supported Colleges

Cupid currently operates in the following colleges and nearby campuses:

JECRC University

IIT Jodhpur

Banasthali Vidyapeeth

BITS Pilani

LNMIIT Jaipur

We are expanding rapidly to more universities and campuses soon.

7. Our Plans

Cupid offers two main plans ‚Äî ‚Çπ99 and ‚Çπ249 ‚Äî along with an additional crush-help feature.

üíû Plan 1: Standard Plan (‚Çπ99)

You receive a match based on your provided preferences and data.

Personality compatibility is given the highest priority.

The matchmaking depends on profile availability and data alignment.

There is no refund policy for this plan.

This plan ensures you get the most suitable match possible within your chosen criteria, but we do not guarantee a 100% match.

üíé Plan 2: Premium Plan (‚Çπ249)

You will be shown the most compatible and suitable matches first.

You can then choose the one you prefer the most.

If you do not find any match suitable or do not receive a match, you are eligible for a full refund.

However, if you already received a match and conversations have started, the refund policy no longer applies.

This plan gives you priority in matching, better visibility, and personalized matchmaking suggestions.

üí¨ Crush Enquiry Service (‚Çπ49)

Cupid also helps you if you want to know more about your crush.
If there‚Äôs someone you like, or you want to know whether your crush likes someone else, you can request our Crush Information Service.

We will analyze that person‚Äôs Cupid form data (if they‚Äôve participated) and let you know whether there‚Äôs a possibility of mutual interest or compatibility and if they haven't apply in the round, we will ask them personally and you identity will remain anonymous.

8. Is It First-Come-First-Serve?

No. Cupid does not operate on a first-come-first-serve basis.
Matches are decided purely on compatibility, data quality, and mutual preferences but yeah if we have profiles who have almost same preferences and same basic infos then priority will be like this 249 plan user(who came first)> 249 plan user(who came after)>99 plan user (who came first)> 99 plan user (who came after)

Every participant, regardless of when they submitted their form, is given equal consideration. The goal is to ensure the best possible and most relevant matches, not just the earliest ones.

9. Pricing Logic ‚Äì Why Do We Charge?

Cupid‚Äôs pricing is not random. The small entry fee helps us:

Maintain gender ratio balance between male and female participants.

Prevent spam or fake entries.

Fund operational costs such as server processing and manual verification.

If we were to make Cupid completely free, we would receive a massive number of male entries, making it impossible to ensure balanced matchmaking.

The fees help us create fair and structured matching rounds, ensuring every user has a reasonable chance to find a compatible partner.

10. Refund Policy

Refunds apply only in specific conditions:

Technical issues before matchmaking begins.

No suitable match found under the ‚Çπ249 plan.

Refunds are not applicable once a match has been made and the conversation has started.

To claim a refund, users must email cupid.livepro@gmail.com
 with payment proof within 3 days of form submission.

Refunds are not available for the ‚Çπ99 plan.

11. What Happens If You Don‚Äôt Get a Match?

Matchmaking depends on availability and compatibility. If none of the users matched your non-negotiables or preferences, you may not receive a match in that round.

In such cases:

‚Çπ99 plan users can reapply in the next round.

‚Çπ249 plan users will either get a refund or early access in the next round.

Cupid cannot guarantee a match in every attempt ‚Äî because finding the right person depends on both data and luck.

12. Team and Background

Cupid is not a random page ‚Äî it‚Äôs built and managed by college students who understand what modern college dating feels like.

Our founder and lead matchmaker is a Computer Science student in 2nd year, passionate about combining technology, data, and emotions to create better human connections.

We are not from any single college; Cupid operates independently to ensure neutrality and fairness in matchmaking.

13. Key Statistics

540+ successful matches completed so far.

Operating across 5+ major campuses.

Trusted by hundreds of students every month.

90% user satisfaction rate reported through feedback forms.
